# Hello, World! <Image src="/img/wave.gif" alt="Waving" width="48" height="48" />

I'm **Nelson** and I have a degree in [Economics](https://www.eeg.uminho.pt/pt/estudar/Licenciaturas/Paginas/economia.aspx) and another in [Software Engineering](https://miei.di.uminho.pt/plano_estudos.html) both from the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt) where I am currently doing a masters degree in **Data Science** and **Distributed Systems**.

I'm at the moment Treasurer of the **[Software Engineering Students Association (CeSIUM)](https://cesium.di.uminho.pt)** and I have been an active member since my freshman year. I have helped organize multiple editions of our **[Software Engineering Week (SEI)](https://seium.org)**, a five-day-event, with dozens of talks and a 48 hours hackathon over the weekend.

I co-organize the 2020 edition of **[ENEI](https://2020.enei.pt)**, that happened at the [Altice Forum Braga](https://forumbraga.com/) with 600 attendees and more than 30 companies. This national conference aims to bring together informatics, computer science and engineering students to learn, socialize and connect with each other and the business world.

I have been co-leading the **[CoderDojo at Braga](https://www.instagram.com/coderdojobraga/)** since 2018, an open, non-profit, free movement which aims to teach programming to children and teenagers from 7 to 17.

Back in 2017, I joined **[#include <braga\>](https://www.instagram.com/includebraga/)**, a volunteering movement that makes a direct positive impact in the local community through tech. While I was there, I helped organize two editions of [Secret Santa](https://include-secret-santa.herokuapp.com/) in which they involved more than 160 children, young and old in disadvantaged social conditions.
