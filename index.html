      <p>
        I'm <span class="focus">Nelson</span> and I have a degree in
        <a
          href="https://www.eeg.uminho.pt/pt/estudar/Licenciaturas/Paginas/economia.aspx"
          >Economics</a

        and another in
        <a href="https://miei.di.uminho.pt/plano_estudos.html"
          >Software Engineering</a
        >
        both from the
        <a href="https://www.uminho.pt">University of Minho</a> where I am
        currently doing a masters degree in
        <span class="focus">Data Science</span> and
        <span class="focus">Distributed Systems</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm at the moment Treasurer of the
        <a class="focus" href="https://cesium.di.uminho.pt"
          >Software Engineering Students Association (CeSIUM)</a
        >
        and I have been an active member since my freshman year. I have helped
        organize multiple editions of our
        <a class="focus" href="https://seium.org"
          >Software Engineering Week (SEI)</a
        >, a five-day-event, with dozens of talks and a 48 hours hackathon over
        the weekend.
      </p>

      <p>
        I co-organize the 2020 edition of
        <a class="focus" href="https://2020.enei.pt">ENEI</a>, that happened at
        the <a href="https://forumbraga.com/">Altice Forum Braga</a> with 600
        attendees and more than 30 companies. This national conference aims to
        bring together informatics, computer science and engineering students to
        learn, socialize and connect with each other and the business world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been co-leading the
        <a class="focus" href="https://www.instagram.com/coderdojobraga/"
          >CoderDojo at Braga</a
        >
        since 2018, an open, non-profit, free movement which aims to teach
        programming to children and teenagers from 7 to 17.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back in 2017, I joined
        <a class="focus" href="https://www.instagram.com/includebraga/"
          >#include &lt;braga&gt;</a
        >, a volunteering movement that makes a direct positive impact in the
        local community through tech. While I was there, I helped organize two
        editions of
        <a href="https://include-secret-santa.herokuapp.com/">Secret Santa</a>
        in which they involved more than 160 children, young and old in
        disadvantaged social conditions.

      <!-- <p>
        I'm a 21-year-old software engineering student at University of Minho, Braga,
        Portugal. I concluded my BSc and I’m starting now a MSc in Application
        Engineering and Intelligent Systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently I’m the General Responsible of ENEI, an annual Portuguese conference
        that aims to bring together informatics, computer science and engineering
        students to learn, socialize and connect with each other and the business
        world. I'm also Director of Communications Department at CeSIUM, a Software
        Engineering Students Center, whose main goals are to represent and promote the
        course and Mentor and Co-organizer at CoderDojo Braga, an open, non-profit,
        free movement which aims to teach programming to children and teenagers from 7
        to 17. I'm also a Collaborator of Sports and Culture Department at University
        of Minho.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time I like to practice sports, read technical or non-technical
        books and watch some shows.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer at Subvisual where I build awesome web apps
        using Elixir. I'm currently living in sunny ole Portugal, specifically
        in Braga.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before returning to Subvisual, I spent some time at thoughtbot and at
        Utrust. At the latter, I helped raise a very successful ICO and build
        their novel blockchain payments gateway.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have an MSc in Distributed Systems and Cryptography from University
        of Minho, having won multiple awards for academic excellence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back in 2017, I founded #include <braga>, a non-profit, open source
        movement that makes use of the superpowers developers have to make a
        direct positive impact in the local community. The movement is
        mentioned and explained in my "you and the morals of technology" talk.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also co-lead Coderdojo Braga for several years, overseeing a growth
        from 3 mentors and an average of 10 attendees to 30 mentors and as many
        attendees. I loved every bit of it and helping the project grow was one
        of my favourite endeavours.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a regular speaker at conferences and meetups, as well as lovely
        company, I've heard. I'm currently available for speaking engagements,
        if you are looking for someone to speak at your conference, meetup or
        institution.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also think programming communities are just the best and helped
        organise Ruby Conf Portugal, Mirror Conf, Braga.js and Braga.BEAM. If
        you need help with your community event, feel free to reach out.
