<HelloWorld />

I'm **Nelson**, and I am a Software Engineer at **[Marmela][marmelasoft.com]**,
specializing in [Elixir][elixir] with [Phoenix][phoenix] and Phoenix LiveView to
build robust and scalable applications that provide exceptional user experiences.

My academic background includes a degree in [Economics][eco-uminho] and another
in [Software Engineering][lei-uminho], both from the [University of
Minho][uminho], where I also did a one year specialization in **Data Science**
and **Distributed Systems**.

I'm a former President of the **[Software Engineering Students Association
(CeSIUM)][cesium]**, and I was an active member since my freshman year and will
remain a lifelong associate. I have helped organize multiple editions of our
**[Software Engineering Week (SEI)][seium]**, a five-day event with dozens of
talks and a 48 hours hackathon over the weekend. I co-hosted one season of
CeSIUM's Podcast called **["Perif√©rico"][periferico-yt]** which is [available on
most platforms][periferico].

I co-organize the 2020 edition of **[ENEI][enei-2020]**, which
happened at the [Altice Forum Braga][forum-braga] with 600
attendees and more than 30 companies. This national conference aims to bring
together informatics, computer science and engineering students to learn,
socialize and connect with each other and the business world.

While I was an active member of CeSIUM, I have co-lead the **[CoderDojo at
Braga][dojo-braga]** since 2018, an open, non-profit, free movement which aims
to teach programming to children and teenagers from 7 to 17.

Back in 2017, I joined **[#include &lt;braga&gt;][include-braga]**, a volunteering
movement that directly impacted the local community through tech. While I was
there, I helped organize two editions of **[Secret Santa][secret-santa]**,
which involved more than 160 children, young and old in disadvantaged social
conditions.
